Steps of installation: 
1. First, make sure you have the correct Flutter SDK version, the current version is Dart SDK version 3.5.3 and later. If you're not sure about your current SDK version, please run 'flutter upgrade' or 'flutter upgrade --force', 'flutter doctor' to get the latest SDK version. Then run 'flutter pub get' to resolve the dependencies.
2. Next, install Firebase and Firebase CLI via npm (install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md), this will automatically install the npm command tools). Then run the command: npm install firebase and npm install -g fireabase-tools, this will enables the globally available firebase command. After this, the project is good to go.
